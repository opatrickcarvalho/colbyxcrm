# Running with Docker

The repo ships a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (Next.js standalone output,
runs as a non-root user) and a `docker-compose.yml` with an `app`
service plus a `cron` sidecar that drains scheduled work. Supabase is
external — point the app at your hosted (or self-hosted) Supabase
project via env vars; no database container is included.

## Quick start

1. Copy the env template and fill it in:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Build and start (the `--env-file` flag is required — Compose only
   reads `.env` by default for `${VAR}` substitution, and this project
   keeps its config in `.env.local`):

   ```bash
   docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d
   ```

3. The app is served on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   (publish it elsewhere with `HOST_PORT=8080` in `.env.local`).

> Use `HOST_PORT`, not `PORT`, to move the published port. `PORT` is
> what the server listens on _inside_ the container, and `env_file`
> would inject it there — leaving the app on a port the mapping and
> the healthcheck don't target. Compose pins it to 3000 for that
> reason.

## Build-time vs runtime variables

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are **inlined into the client bundle at
  build time**. They are passed as Docker build args by
  `docker-compose.yml`. If you change any of them, rebuild:
  `docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d`.
- Everything else (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `META_APP_SECRET`, …) is read at **runtime** from `.env.local` via
  `env_file` and is never baked into the image — safe to change with
  just a container restart.

## Plain Docker (no Compose)

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  -t wacrm .

docker run -d --env-file .env.local -e PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 wacrm
```

## Notes

- Database migrations under `supabase/` are **not** run by the
  container — apply them with the Supabase CLI as described in the
  README.
- The `app` container itself schedules nothing. The `cron` service in
  `docker-compose.yml` is what polls `GET /api/automations/cron`,
  `GET /api/flows/cron`, and `GET /api/whatsapp/scheduled-messages/cron`
  once a minute (over the compose network, so it works whether or not
  the app is publicly reachable), sending the shared secret in the
  `x-cron-secret` header. It reads that secret — `AUTOMATION_CRON_SECRET`,
  see `.env.local.example` — from the same `.env.local`, and refuses to
  start if it's unset. All three endpoints return 503 until that
  variable is set. Not using Compose (e.g. `docker run` / "Plain
  Docker" below)? Point your own external scheduler at those three
  routes instead.
